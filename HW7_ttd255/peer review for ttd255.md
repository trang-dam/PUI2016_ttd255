#Peer Review for ttd255 Plot Assignment:

##**FIGURE:**

##**CLARITY:** It's unclear what the purple portion of the lines represents. I'm assuming its the fraction of crash victims neither killed or injured, but it would be good to include this in the legend. Also, I'm unsure why each bar only has either red or blue at the top - should they each have some of both? (i.e., some people were killed, others injured during the same hour.) Additionally, I would add a title to your plot at the top (I do see it at the bottom, so that's fine too!) and maybe include where this data was gathered (what country), or at least mention the data source in the caption.

##**ESTHETIC:** I think I would switch the colors so that red represents deaths - in my mind, that is a harsher color and is more associated with death than the light blue. Overall thought it looks really pleasing to the eye and easy to read. 

##**HONESTY:** The error bars were a very good way to help the viewer see what bars are significantly different from those close in height to them, and increased the honesty of the graph. A description of those bars (since each bar includes 2) would be helpful in the caption, though.
